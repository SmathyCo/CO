# CO: A New Programming Language

Welcome to CO, an open-source programming language that's currently in development!

## What is CO?

CO is an innovative programming language designed to unify various programming languages into a single, versatile platform. Our goal is to create a language that balances high-level readability with low-level control, offering a syntax that is intuitive and human-readable. Whether you're coding complex applications or scripting simple tasks, CO aims to provide a flexible environment that supports a wide range of programming needs.

## How Will CO Achieve This?

You might be wondering how CO will integrate multiple programming languages. Our approach involves using a powerful interpreter that dynamically handles different programming languages based on your requirements. When you need a compiler for specific tasks, you can easily switch configurations using `coe init` to adjust the `settings.co.json` file. This flexibility ensures that CO can adapt to various programming paradigms, making it a robust tool for diverse projects.
