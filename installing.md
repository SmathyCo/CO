# How to install everything?

1. Open a command prompt as administrator.
2. Navigate inside the ./src/ folder of the project.
3. Run the ./index.bat file that is inside the ./src/ folder.
4. It should open a command prompt window and you just need to wait for it to install the dependencies.
5. Close the command prompts you are using and reopen the ones that you will use for the project.
6. Now you can use `co ./index.co` to run a co file!
